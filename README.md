# NoTimeOffMod

This mod makes it so that going to the company moon costs a day like other moons! That's right--coming here to buy items, selling early, everything. It all costs money! **This mod is required on all clients for it to work properly.**

## Future plans

- I plan to add more moon customization to the mod.
- (Maybe) A chance to not count a day.

## Known Issues

- There is an issue when cycling 1 Day Left to 0 Days left where the game will flash the deadline for a second on one of the screens. This shouldn't actually affect gameplay. 

## Known incompatibilities

- Any mod that messes with the day system in Lethal Company has a chance to cause issues or conflicts with how this mod works. I will address issues as I can as they come up.
